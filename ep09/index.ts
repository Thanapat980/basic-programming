Despite being a naive-looking teenager, he is not to be underestimated. Unmatched in battle, Luffy is a pirate himself who resolutely pursues the coveted One Piece treasure and the King of the Pirates title that comes with it.\n\nThe late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, stirred up the world before his death by disclosing the whereabouts of his hoard of riches and daring everyone to obtain it. Ever since then, countless powerful pirates have sailed dangerous seas for the prized One Piece only to never return. Although Luffy lacks a crew and a proper ship, he is endowed with a superhuman ability and an unbreakable spirit that make him not only a formidable adversary but also an inspiration to many.\n\nAs he faces numerous challenges with a big smile on his face, Luffy gathers one-of-a-kind companions to join him in his ambitious endeavor, together embracing perils and wonders on their once-in-a-lifetime adventure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
            "background": "Several anime-original arcs have been adapted into light novels, and the series has inspired 50+ video games as of 2023. In June 2004, One Piece was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment, which partnered with Viz Media for home video distribution. As One Piece proved unsuitable for their target demographic, 4Kids Entertainment censored the show to meet their standards, and, in December 2006, they stopped its production. In April 2007, Funimation took over the series licensing, providing an uncut version that remained faithful to the original release. In Japan, the anime's first 574 episodes were released exclusively on DVD by Avex Pictures from February 21, 2001, to December 4, 2013. Blu-rays also became available with the DVDs starting on January 8, 2014. In North America, Viz Media released the anime on DVD between February 28, 2006, and June 26, 2007. Funimation has re-released and continued the series since May 27, 2008. From March 23, 2021, the DVDs were accompanied by Blu-rays as well.",

Buena Festa, the festival organizer, invites the Straw Hats and all Worst Generation crews to partake in the festivities. Luring even Shichibukai and Marines to its shores, it seems that no pirate or sailor can resist the enticing secrets that the event hides behind its glamor.\n\nThe festival's contest is simple: find one of the treasures Gol D. Roger left behind. As the competition progresses, the various pirate crews fight each other in a free-for-all battle royale—that is, until the sudden appearance of an unexpected pirate drastically changes the game.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Drawn in by the chances of hitting the jackpot, the crew immediately head to the casino. There, they quickly find themselves on a winning streak, playing with what seems to be endless luck.\n\nWhen offered a special gamble by Gild Tesoro—the master of the city himself—the crew agrees, choosing to believe in their captain's luck. However, when they find themselves victims of a despicable scam, the crew quickly realize that there is something darker happening beneath the city's surface.\n\nLeft penniless and beaten down, the Straw Hat Crew are forced to rely on another gamble of a plan. With the help of a new friend or two, the group must work to reclaim what they've lost before time, and what remains of their luck, runs out.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On their way, however, an outlandish pirate ship appears out of the sky, helmed by the infamous pirate Shiki \"the Golden Lion\"—a man who ate the Float-Float Fruit and the first ever prisoner to escape from Impel Down. In his quest to defeat the World Government, Shiki kidnaps Nami to be his own navigator and sends the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates to his floating islands as hostages, leaving her in a dilemma. Separated in a land under Shiki's absolute control, Luffy and his crew must survive the mystifying terrain in order to bring back their navigator and friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
